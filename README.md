# TensorflowJSIonic

Implementation of TensorflowJS on Ionic

<p> Using a bird classification model for example. 
The model takes time to load as is it fetched from
the internet while all the computation takes place
on the phone itself.
</p>

<p> Very primitive app, the functionaloties shall 
improve soon.
